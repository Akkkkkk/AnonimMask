# AnonimMask (Plugin Request)
Simple plugin that changes the name when you click on the powder. (Request)


How the plugin works: if you right click on the powder in your hand, it renames the TAB and the user name and sends a message to player.
If the user removes it, everything goes back to normal (I'm not sure if it keeps a modified nametab).

Config: Modifiable messages!
